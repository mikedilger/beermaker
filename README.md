# Beermaker

This is a library to help you make beer.

Usually you would specify a process, specify a recipe, and then print that recipe.
The printout will contain etailed instructions for you with all calculations
done. See the [example](examples/marzen.rs) and try running it:

```rust
cargo run --example marzen
```

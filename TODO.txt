Ppg: retire this, use fermentability (which according to sugar.rs
	is ppg / 46.0.

pH-offset: recipe option to specify a measured Ph offset

Unfermentability: Points isn't enough. We want to know what percent
	of those points are fermentable, independent of yeast
    attenuation.  Use like we do the unfermentability of sugar.
	JP says yeast attenuation is an 'average'. JP also says
    malts have on average 25% unfermentable dextrins and
    14% maltotriose (some yeast doesn't ferment this).

Lagering vessel is not selected, lagering steps are missing.

Terminology: use the terms liquor and grist.

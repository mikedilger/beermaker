Water Minerals:
  * Add Ca and Mg to help offset Alkalinity for mash pH
  * Add Ca because Ca should be between 50 and 150
  * Add Cl and SO4 in a ratio to accentuate malt or hops
  * Avoid too many minerals or it will taste over mineralized

  * Ca:   50 - 150  Yeast Health, Enzyme Function, Clarity
  * Mg:   10 - 30   Yeast nutrient
  * SO4:  50 - 150 (balanced), 150 - 350 (bitter/dry)
  * Cl:    0 - 250  Enhances malt sweetness and body
  * Na:    0 - 150  Enhances flavor, but don't go salty
  * HCO3:  0 - 250  Raises mash pH (counteracts acid malts)

  Balanced:   Ca= 80, Mg= 5, Na=25, Cl= 75, SO4=80, HCO3=100

  Balanced2:  Ca=150, Mg=10, Na=80, Cl=150, SO4=160, HCO3=220


Ppg: retire this, use fermentability (which according to sugar.rs
	is ppg / 46.0.

pH-offset: recipe option to specify a measured Ph offset

Unfermentability: Points isn't enough. We want to know what percent
	of those points are fermentable, independent of yeast
    attenuation.  Use like we do the unfermentability of sugar.
	JP says yeast attenuation is an 'average'. JP also says
    malts have on average 25% unfermentable dextrins and
    14% maltotriose (some yeast doesn't ferment this).

Lagering vessel is not selected, lagering steps are missing.

Terminology: use the terms liquor and grist.

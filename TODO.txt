pH calculation could use some love.

Partial Boil Dilution:  Right now we have to specify it in
     liters (in the process). But we could compute it
     automatically as whatever reaches the  max kettle
     volume.

Post Ferment Dilution:  Right now we have to specify it in
     liters. But we could compute it automatically by
     specifying the target product ABV in the recipe, and
     then applying whatever dilution provides the ABV
     specified in the recipe. We should error if the ABV
     is too low to reach the target.  This field should be
     called a dilution_abv_target so users don't think
     it adjusts gravity.

Terminology: use the terms liquor and grist.
